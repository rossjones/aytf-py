## aytf (python edition)

Not quite a FORTH, in Python.


### Dependencies

```python -m pip -r requirements.txt```

### Tests

```pytests ```

### TODO

* Don't use a singleton for compiling : words
* Try not to use a `collector` func for comments and : words
* Do the builtin words REALLY need to have a reference to the Machine?
* Comment stuff so I don't forget how it works (FSVO works)
